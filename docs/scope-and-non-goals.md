# Scope and Non-Goals

## Goal
Confirm the project scope and non-goals as defined in `README.md`, without changes.

## Scope (Confirmed)
- Personal iOS music player built around a single Plex music library.
- Album-first listening and discovery, with shuffle as a primary interaction.
- Plex is the source of truth for library structure, metadata, and ratings.
- User can add and remove albums from Plex album collections.
- App focuses on reliability, rediscovery, and emotional context over mass-market features.

## Non-Goals (Confirmed)
- Not a general Plex client or Plexamp replacement.
- No playlist editing.
- No multi-server abstraction.
- No podcast/audiobook support.
- No social features.
- No desktop client.
- No full Plex client parity.

## Personal-Tool Intent (Recorded)
Lunara is a personal tool optimized for a single user's listening habits, prioritizing listening joy, rediscovery, and reliability over broad appeal or feature parity.
